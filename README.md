# 👋 Hi there, I'm Pierre Bellegueule!

## 🚀 About Me

At 22, I've already designed, built, and launched several complex projects in the Web3 space — including an NFT marketplace, decentralized exchange, flash loan protocols, and more. I also founded a startup incubated at Euratechnologies, and led technical workshops to train other developers on smart contracts with MultiversX (Rust/WASM).

I'm a fullstack developer (React, Node.js, TypeScript) with a strong specialization in blockchain development (Rust, smart contract architecture, and security). I love both building products from scratch and optimizing existing stacks. Most importantly, I bring a product mindset, a focus on code quality, and a drive to create real impact.

🔥 I'm currently looking for a Lead or Senior Developer role in an ambitious team (crypto or cutting-edge tech), with strong technical and product challenges. Open to remote or on-site opportunities across Europe and Switzerland.

💬 Always happy to connect — feel free to reach out!
